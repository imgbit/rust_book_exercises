# Rust Book Exercises Solutions
This project contains solutions to exercises from the Rust Book, a comprehensive guide to the Rust programming language. Each chapter of the book has a number of exercises designed to reinforce the concepts learned in that chapter. This repository contains solutions to those exercises.

# Getting Started
To get started, you will need to have Rust installed on your machine. If you don't have Rust installed, you can download it from the official Rust website.

Once Rust is installed, you can clone this repository by running the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/imgbit/rust_book_exercises.git`

# Usage
Each chapter of the book has its own Rust file in this repository. To run the solutions, simply navigate to the main directory containing main.rs and run the following command:

`cargo run`

This will compile and run the Rust program containing all the solutions to the exercises. You should see the output of the program in your terminal.

`cargo test`

This will compile and run all the unit tests defined in the Rust source files for the exercises. You should see the results of the tests in your terminal.
